# Project Instagram 

## Product Vision <br />

**FOR**: Instagram influencers and general users <br />
**WHO** need general analytical insight, track followers, unfollowers, and trends based on the statistics of their profiles: <br />
The **Project Instagram** is a **Web application** <br />
**THAT** provides analytical performance of a user's instagram profile including likes, followers, trends, and more statistical features <br />
**UNLIKE** other unfollower applications on mobile that require payment and provide very limited functionality <br />

## Personas <br />
**Adelina, a college student** <br />
Adelina, age 20, is a college student attending Temple University in Philadelphia. She is involved in various different social clubs on campus and is in a major that requires a lot of networking and connections. Adelina's instagram profile is very important to her because she uses that as her image online where if people look her up, they will recieve her first impressions of her on there. Since Adelina is using instagram as a marketing tool to sell herself, it is very important she sees how her profile is doing including to see if pictures she post attract followers or detract followers. Adelina would also want to know who unfollows her in order to get a scope of who still wants to remain in her network and who does not. As a generation Z human being, Adelina is a very heavy user on instagram and uses it for her personal endeavors as well. Many of her friends and people her age are on instagram frequently. Adelina would benefit from the statistical app because it would give her awareness of her profile, figure out what posting behaviors grow her profile and which do not.
